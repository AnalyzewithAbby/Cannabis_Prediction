# Cannabis Use Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict cannabis use among university students in Ghana. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to build a model that identifies factors influencing cannabis use and provides valuable insights for intervention and support programs.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to student demographics, lifestyle, and social behaviors. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

## Model Building

The following machine learning models were explored:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Gradient Boosting**
4. **Neural Networks**

The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The best-performing model was Logitic Regression achieved an accuracy of **87%** with an F1 score of **85%**. Key features influencing cannabis use included **[Friends use of cannabis]**, **[Social life effect]** etc.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Richard-Gidi/Cannabis_Prediction.git>
